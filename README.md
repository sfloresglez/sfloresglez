### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me talk you a bit about myself:

    ghost I'm an (almost) engineer who is always finding ways to challenge and develop his own creativity along with his skill set. Lately got a special interest in coding mostly Python with approach into Machine Learning and C to embedded systems.

    telescope Iâ€™m currently working on my research project aimed to help me to get my bachelors degree (Can you pray by me? I'd Really appreciate it.)

    seedling Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C, Scrum and Machine learning with Python. Being honest, I'm an entry-level developer, but I'm motivated. Lately change my OS, now I'm falling in love with Ubuntu.

    dancers Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.

    thinking Iâ€™m looking for help with Python, Ubuntu, C and in a few days with Azure.
