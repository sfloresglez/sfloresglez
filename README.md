# Hi Folks !!! 👋

## Let me talk you a bit about myself:

🦾  I'm an young and ambitious engineer who is always finding ways to challenge and develop his own creativity along with his skill set. Lately got a special interest in coding mostly Python with approach into Machine Learning and C to embedded systems.

✈️  I’m currently learning Python, C, Scrum and Machine learning with Python. Being honest, I'm an entry-level developer, but I'm motivated. Lately change my OS, now I'm falling in love with Ubuntu.

🩹  I’m looking for help with Python, Ubuntu, C and in a few days with Azure.

🤔  Ask me about IoT, Mechanical Design, Philosophy and Rock 'n Roll
